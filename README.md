# Car-class-and-Car_price-prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Built Machine learning model which can predict price and class of a car.

# Problem statement:
The automobile industry is constantly growing and evolving, with the emergence of new technologies and features that make cars more advanced and sophisticated. The increasing number of car models and brands in the market has made it challenging for customers to determine the value of a car or classify it into a specific category. Therefore, car price prediction and car class classification have become crucial tasks in the automotive industry.

# Objective:
The objective of this project was to determine the optimal machine learning algorithm for car price prediction and car class classification. We evaluated the performance of each algorithm using different metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, accuracy, and F1-score. Our findings will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms for car price prediction and car class classification.
